# Virtual Instron
This ROS package and associated GUI make use of the 6-axis force/torque sensor on the Universal Robot e-series to apply complex loads to things. We can essentially perform tests similar to an Instron Uniaxial Testing machine, but in all axis.


## Installation
1. Clone this package to the `src` folder of your catkin workspace
2. In the root folder of your workspace, install dependencies:
    - `rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src -r -y`
3. Build the workspace: `catkin_make`


## Usage
_Instructions coming soon._
